(** [Prefixset.t] models sets of infinitely long bit-strings which can be
    described by a finite set of prefixes common to the members.  These sets
    can also be considered subsets of unit interval \[0, 1\] in which case
    prefixes are the leading decimals of the binary representation of
    members.

    In the following we use [·] to represent concatenation of bit-strings
    along with regular set operations to describe modelled sets. *)

(** A prefix is represented by a [Bitstring]. *)

(** The set type. *)

(** [equal sA sB] is true iff [sA] and [sB] contain the same members. *)

val is_prefix : t -> bool

(** If [is_prefix s], then [to_prefix s] returns the [p] such that [equal s
    (of_prefix p)], otherwise it raises [Invalid_argument]. *)

(** [appose sA sB] is the set whose lower and upper halves are [sA] and [sB]
    shrunk to half their size by prefixing their elements by [0] and [1],
    respectively. *)

(** [prefix_fold f s] is the function [f p_(n-1) ∘ ⋯ ∘ f p_0] where [{p_i}]
    is the minimal set of prefixes which cover [s]. *)

(** [rel_compl sC sA] is the relative complement [sA ∖ sC]. *)
val rel_compl : t -> t -> t

(** [abs_compl s] is the absolute complement [∁ s]. *)
val abs_compl : t -> t

(** [compl_decomp s] returns a pair [(sC, sA)] such that [s] equals [sA ∖ sC].
