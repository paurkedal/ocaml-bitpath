(** The [Bitpath_cover_map] implements a mappings from sets of infinite
    bit-strings, representable by a finite set of common prefixes.  In other
    words, the domain has the same structure as the sets modelled by
    [Bitpath_cover].  Both polymorphic and a functor variants are provided to
    abstract over the codomain, though the former only contains the part of
    the API which do not depend on equality. *)

(** The polymorphic API to prefix-maps contains the subset of the operations
    which do not depend on equality on the codomain.  Note that the API is
    really incomplete, and must be combined with the functor API.  This is
    made possible by the type equality [Make(C).t = C.t Poly.t].  The purpose
    of this module is to allow writing polymorphic functions acting on
    pre-constructed maps.

    See {!Make} for documentation. *)
